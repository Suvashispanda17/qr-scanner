# qr-scanner

🚀 Just developed a simple yet effective QR Code Scanner using Python! 📱✨

The program captures QR codes via webcam, decodes the content, and instantly opens the embedded URL in the web browser. Using libraries like pyzbar for decoding and OpenCV for video capture, the scanner detects new QR codes and ensures no duplicate scans. Perfect for automating web-based QR code interactions!

Excited to explore more with Python and computer vision! 🔍💻
